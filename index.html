            1953 to 1958 - Attends St Albans school in North London, where he develops a passion for mathematics.
            1959 to 1962 - Specialises in physics at University College Oxford. Graduates with a first class degree in
            natural sciences.
            1963 - Begins research in cosmology and general relativity at the University of Cambridge. He is diagnosed
            with an ALS at the age of 21,a rare progressive disease that effects movement and speech. He is given a life
            expectancy of 2 years
            1965 - He earns his PhD with a thesis titled 'Properties of Expanding Universes'
            1965 - He marries Jane Wilde, with whom he has three children before they separate after 25 years.
            1966 - Completes his doctorate and is awarded a fellowship at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge.
            1968 - He theorizes that black holes can evaporate through Hawking radiation
            1970 - Discovers a remarkable property: by using quantum theory and general relativity he is able to show
            that black holes can emit radiation.
            1973 - Joins the department of applied mathematics and theoretical physics at Cambridge.
            1973 - He publishes his first academic book, 'The Large Scale Structure of Space-Time'
            1974 - He becomes at 32 one of the youngest members of the Royal Society, Britain's most prestigious
            scientific body.
            1974 - He starts using a wheelchair full-time.
            1974 - He discovers that black holes could leak energy and particles into space, and even explode in a
            fountain of high-energy sparks. His discovery is published in the journal Nature, in a paper entitled
            Blackhole Explosion?
            1977 - Appointed professor of gravitational physics at Cambridge.
            1979 - Appointed Lucasian professor of mathematics at Cambridge (a chair held by Sir Isaac Newton in 1663).
            Elected as a fellow of the Royal Society.
            1982 - Awarded a CBE by the Queen.
            1985 - He loses the ability to speak after undergoing a tracheotomy to help him breathe after contracting
            pneumonia. This results eventually in his use of a computer and a voice synthesiser to communicate.
            1988 - Publishes A Brief History of Time: From the Big Bang to Black Holes, a classic introduction to
            today's most important scientific ideas about the cosmos. Recorded in the 1998 Guinness Book of Records as
            an all-time bestseller.
            1993 - Publishes Black Holes and Baby Universes, and other Essays, a collection of scientific articles
            exploring ways in which the universe may be governed.
            1995 - He marries his former nurse, Elaine Mason; they too divorce after several years.
            1998 - Publishes Stephen Hawking's Universe: The Cosmos Explained, a book about the basis of our existence
            and of everything around us.
            2001 - Releases Universe in a Nutshell in the UK, a book that unravels the mysteries of recent breakthroughs
            in physics.
            2002 - Releases On the Shoulders of Giants, The Great Works of Physics and Astronomy, an exploration of some
            of the greatest visionaries in the history of science including Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo, Newton and
            Einstein.
            2002 - Publishes The Theory of Everything: The Origin and Fate of the Universe, a book that presents the
            most complex theories of physics past and present.
            2004 - Hawking announces that he has solved the Black Hole paradox, which has been a troubling scientists
            for years. He presents his most recent findings at the international conference on general relativity and
            gravitation in Dublin.
            2007 - He goes on a weightless flight in the United States as a prelude to a hoped-for sub-orbital
            spaceflight.
            2009 - Given the highest civilian honor in the US, the Presidential Medal of Freedom
            2013 - Publishes memoir, 'My Brief History'
